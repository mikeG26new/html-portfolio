    <h3>
        Caddy Shack
    </h3>
    <p>
        For some mindless entertainment, you cannot go wrong with Caddy Shack. Many qoutes are instantly reconizable. 
        For example. "It in the hole" or "keep playing through the heavy stuff". You will find someone whom will understand what you are talking about.

    <h3> The Best Years of our Lives</h3>
    <p>
        The film portrayed three men returning home after deployment. Each one of the men has to struggle to adapt to postwar life.
